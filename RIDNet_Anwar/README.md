### Quick start
1. Download the trained models for our paper and place them in '/TestCode/experiment'.

    The real denoising model can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QxO6KFOVxaYYiwxliwngxhw_xCtInSHd) or [here](https://icedrive.net/0/e3Cb4ifYSl). The total size for all models is 5MB.

2. Cd to '/TestCode/code', run the following scripts.

    **You can use the following script to test the algorithm**

    ```bash
    #RIDNET
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --data_test MyImage --noise_g 1 --model RIDNET --n_feats 64 --pre_train ../experiment/ridnet.pt --test_only --save_results --save 'RIDNET_RNI15' --testpath ../LR/LRBI/ --testset RNI15
    ```
